## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

This challenge helped me improve my layout structure, spacing and component styling.
I also became more comfortable building responsive UIs.

```html
<section class="hero">
  <h1>A history of everything you copy</h1>
</section>
css
نسخ الكود
.btn {
  padding: 12px 30px;
  border-radius: 30px;
  transition: .3s ease;
}
js
نسخ الكود
console.log("Clipboard Landing Page Loaded!");

### Continued development
I want to continue improving in:

Advanced CSS responsiveness

Clean component structure

Animations and UI interactions
